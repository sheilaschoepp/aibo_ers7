Installation instructions:
1. Download and unpack openr_neural_controller.tar.gz and nets.tar.gz.  <path_to_folder> will refer to the directory where you have unpacked these files.
2. Insert a Sony memory stick into a memory card reader that is plugged into your machine.
3. In terminal, go to the memory stick's directory.  On my ubuntu 18.04 machine, this is in /media/<username>/<memory_card_id>.
4. Prepare the media stick with the OPEN-R SDK.  Use the wconsole memory protection option.
> cp -rf /usr/local/OPEN_R_SDK/OPEN_R/MS_ERS7/WCONSOLE/memprot/* .
5. Move the contents of openr_neural_controller/OPENR to the OPEN-R folder on your memory stick.
> cd OPEN-R (you should be in the MS/OPEN-R directory)
> cp -rf <path_to_folder>/openr_neural_controller/OPENR/* .
6. Move the contents of nets to the /MW/DATA/P folder.
> cd MW/DATA/P (you should be in the MS/OPEN-R/MW/DATA/P folder)
> cp -rf <path_to_folder>/nets/* .
7. Eject the memory stick and insert into the AIBO.
